# Testing ports
# Listing ports
# python -m serial.tools.list_ports will print a list of available ports. It is also possible to add a regexp as first argument and the list will only include entries that matched.


# Accessing ports
# pySerial includes a small console based terminal program called serial.tools.miniterm. It can be started with python -m serial.tools.miniterm <port_name> (use option -h to get a listing of all options).
